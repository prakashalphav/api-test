        '<div class="leading-6"><h3 class="text-lg mb-2 mt-5"><b>Introduction</b></h3><p>When you play for the first time, you will be exposed to some of the basic rules of the game as explained below. For starters, players will be dealt two cards face down in Texas Holdem game with the goal of making the best five-card “hand” combination.</p><p>The game is played in turns clockwise around the table, starting with the player to the left of the bookie button. Generally, the two players closest to the dealer button are required to place the small blind and the large blind to start the bet. Then, betting starts along the various stages of play: before the three table cards are opened (preflop), after the three cards are opened (flop), the fourth card (turn), and the last card (river).</p><br><h4 class="text-base mb-2 mt-5"><b>Dealer buttons</b></h4><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/poker_01.png"></p><p>Apart from determining the first players to start the bet with the small blind and the big blind, the bookie button also determines where the playing cards start to be dealt. The player who is right to the left of the bookie button who is required to put up the small blind, gets the first card then the dealer distributes the card to the other players clockwise until each player gets two cards.</p><br><h4 class="text-base mb-2 mt-5"><b>The Blinds</b></h4><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/poker_02.png"></p><p>Every time a new round starts, two players at the table are required to place blinds, or a forced bet that initiates the bet. Without these blinds, the game would be very boring as no player would have to bet money on the round.</p><p>&zwnj;The player directly to the left of the bookie button places the small blind, and the player to the left places the big blind. Generally the small blind amounts to half the big blind, although this rule varies from poker room to room and can also depend on the game being played.</p><br><h4 class="text-base mb-2 mt-5"><b>Game Purpose</b></h4><p>In Texas Holdem, each player receives two cards face down, called Hole Cards. All players keep their cards secret until the end of the betting round, which is called the showdown. Texas Holdem is a community card game, where five cards are put in the middle of the game table to be combined with the two cards the player is holding and make the best five-card combination.</p><p>Five community cards are placed in the center of the playing table in stages: the flop, turn and river. The flop consists of the first three community cards, the turn adds one more card, and the river completes the table with one more card. These five cards are visible to all players. After all five cards have been placed on the table, the players must have the best five-card combination of the seven cards. Combination can be done by combining the two player cards with three community cards, one player card with four community cards or playing all community cards as a "hand" without a single player card. The player with the best card combination wins the pot, which is the total amount of money the players have bet during the game.</p><h4 class="text-base mb-2 mt-5"><b>First Betting Round</b></h4><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/poker_03.jpg"></p><br><h4 class="text-base mb-2 mt-5"><b>Action During Pre-Flop</b></h4><p>Two cards are dealt face down to each player and first round of betting begins.</p><p>The player who takes the first turn to play is the player to the left of the big blind player, and this player has three choices:</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/poker_04.png"></p><p>Call &amp; nbsp; : equalizing the big blind bet</p><p>Raise &amp; nbsp; : increase the stake according to the specific limit of the game</p><p>Fold &amp; nbsp; : discards the "hand" (withdraws from the bet)</p><p>If a player chooses to fold, he or she is no longer eligible to win a “hand” for that round. The amount of stake a player can raise depends on the game itself, but should generally be twice the big blind.</p><p>The next players have the same three choices: Call, Raise or Fold. To increase the stake, it must at least equal the amount of the previous raise. For example, suppose the big blind in that game is $ 10 and the first player increases the stake to $ 40 in an No-Limit Holdem game. The second player has the option to call $ 40, fold and no longer play the "hand", or raise the stake to $ 70 according to the first raise of $ 30, calculated from the difference between the existing stake and the initial big blind.</p><br><h4 class="text-base mb-2 mt-5"><b>Second Betting Round</b></h4><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/poker_05.jpg"></p><br><h4 class="text-base mb-2 mt-5"><b>The Flop</b></h4><p>Three community cards are placed on the table and a new round of betting begins again.</p><p>After the first round of pre-flop betting has been completed, the second round of betting starts with the flop after the first three community cards have been placed.

        '<div class="leading-6 pt-5"><p>This guide covers the basics of the Domino QQ game, counting cards in the game, game rules and everything you need to know as a domino QQ player.</p><h4><b>Get to know dominoes</b></h4><p>There are 28 domino cards in each round of play (maximum 6 players), each player holds 4 cards. Each card has two sides, top and bottom, which are bounded by the center line and the number of dots on each card varies. Each dot shows the value of the card, and the easiest way to remember all dominoes is to group the cards into 7 types of card series as below:</p><p>Series 0 (zero) dots, there are a total of 7 cards and on each card, there is a blank part without dots, it can be the top or bottom of the card.</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_01.png"></p><br><p>Series of 1 (one) point, with a total of 6 cards and there is one big dot on one of the sides of each card (top or bottom).</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_02.png"></p><br><p>Series of 2 (two) dots, with a total of 5 cards and there are two large dots on one of the sides of each card (top or bottom):</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_03.png"></p><br><p>Series of 3 (three) points, totaling 4 cards and there are 3 dots on one of the parts of each card (top or bottom):</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_04.png"></p><br><p>Series of 4 (four) cards, totaling 3 cards and there are 4 dots on one part of each card (top or bottom):</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_05.png"></p><br><p>Series of 5 (five) dots, totaling 2 cards and there are 5 dots on one of the parts of each card (top or bottom):</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_06.png"></p><br><p>Series of 6 (six) dots, there is only 1 card that has 6 dots on the top and bottom:</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_07.png"></p><br><br><h4><b>Counting Domino Cards</b></h4><p>Counting dominoes is done by counting the total number of dots on each card on the left plus the total number of dots on the cards on the right.</p><p>Keep in mind that the highest value in this calculation is 9, if the number of dots is greater than 10, 20, or 30, then the number taken is the last digit of the sum.

The two cards on the left are called the "Left Side" and the two cards on the right are called the "Right Side".</p><p>In this game the value of your card is indicated by Left Side: Right Side. See the following example for details, the numbers in white circles represent the values &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;of both the left and right side cards.</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_09.png"></p><div class="marginleft"><table style="margin-left:90px;width:94%"><tbody><tr><td>Result : 9 4</td><td>Result : 9 8</td><td>Result : 4 3</td></tr><tr><td>Lose</td><td>Win</td><td>Lose</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><br><p>Note: You dont need to count the number of dots on the card when playing, the left and right side values &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;will be automatically displayed in the game. The left side value can be greater than the right side value, or the two side values &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;can be the same. In the Domino QQ 4 card game, there are 5 special mixed cards besides the common cards.</p><h4><b>Kartu Spesial</b></h4><p>The special cards that are shown are the best cards in the domino game and the player who gets these cards will also win the jackpot. The jackpot obtained is in accordance with the purchase of the jackpot and the prize. You can view jackpot rules and prizes on the jackpot menu.</p><p>1 - Six Gods (6666)</p><p>The highest set of special cards. If you have these cards, you will definitely win the game; no other player will have a card like this.</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_10.png"></p><br><p>2 - Four Balak</p><p>The second highest special card set. If you have these four cards, no other player will have a similar card. You will win the game unless another player has 6666 cards.</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_11.png"></p><br><p>3- Pure Great</p><p>Set kartu spesial tertinggi ketiga. Jika total jumlah titik pada kartu-kartu anda sama dengan atau lebih besar dari 40, itu berarti anda mempunyai kartu Murni Besar. Tidak akan ada pemain lain yang mempunyai kartu-kartu berjumlah besar seperti ini, dan anda akan memenangkan permainan, kecuali jika ada pemain lain yang memiliki 6666 atau Empat Balak. Seperti contoh di bawah ini, total jumlah titiknya adalah 41 sehingga tergolong sebagai kartu Murni Besar.</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_12.png"></p><br><p>4 - Small Pure</p><p>The fourth highest special card set. If the total number of dots on your cards is equal to or less than 9, then your card is a Pure Small card, no other player will have small cards like this. You will win the game unless another player has 6666, Four Bales and Big Pure.</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_13.png"></p><br><p>5 - 9 Doubles</p><p>The last special card set is 9 Doubles or QQ which the total value of the two right and left hand cards is 9, so you get a 99 card, the highest value on a normal card. Other players can have the same 9 cards, and the winner is determined based on the one card with the highest value.</p><p>Example: Player with Four Balak hand will win, other players will compare their cards based on the highest total score, if the result is greater than 10, 20, 30, then the number drawn will be the last digit of the counting result.</p><p>The image below shows that the player to the left will win because one card is worth 9, while the player to the right has the highest score of one card is 5.</p><p><img alt="" class="max-w-[100%] my-4" src="https://files.sitestatic.net/images/Tutorial/Poker/domino/domino_14.png"></p></div>',
