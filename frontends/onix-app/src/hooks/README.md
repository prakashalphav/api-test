HOOKS
- to keep our business/functionality logic so that can be reused by components

Types of Hooks : 


a) APP HOOKS
- for global usage. e.g. used in layout.tsx 


b) BUSINESS HOOKS
- use per MODULES

c) UTILS HOOKS
- can use directly by COMPONENTS , to keep the common utitlity type funtionality logic in. 


Notes
You can use hooks within hooks , e.g. useHeader can call the useSideNav hook  as the header UI has btn to open the SideNav
